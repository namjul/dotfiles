# `mimeapps.list` is a configuration file used by Linux desktop environments to map file types and URL schemes to
# default applications. It specifies which application should open a given file type or handle a particular protocol,
# allowing users to set or override the default behaviors established by the system. This file is typically located in
# directories like `~/.config/` for user-specific settings, enabling users to customize their application preferences
# without affecting other users on the system.
